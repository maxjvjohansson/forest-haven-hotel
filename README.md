## Jennies comments

- **store.php line 33-38** it's nice but I don't see why you would need this and not just add a "required" in the tags on the HTML-form? Then you can target it with CSS as well (if you would like to).

- **Over all queries in php to the DB** Some times you use the $query->bindParam and other times you bind the parameter in the execute. I personaly prefere doing it in the execute, as it's one step less and still good readability if you "indent" right.

- **get_bookings.php** I don't get why this function is in a sepperate file and not a part of the functions.php?

- **Book now in the nav** This link isn't smooth scroll it's a jump(default on anchor links). It would be nice if that link also scrolled like the CTA-button, since your page has a full-screen hero.

- **header.php line 31-52** Why is the nav in a div with the logo on the outside? I would recomend having everything in a nav, skip the div and put justify-self: end; on the logo.

- **footer.php** I would use <section> instead as it's a bit more symantic.

- **index.php line 54** Why do you have a <span> within a <p> on the enitre text? I recomend using a class on the <p> tag instead.
